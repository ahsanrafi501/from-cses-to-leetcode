# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the CSES Problem Set implemented in JavaScript.  
The goal of this repository is to practice problem solving, improve logic building, and strengthen algorithmic thinking using JavaScript.

Each file corresponds to a specific problem from the CSES Problem Set.  
The solution directly simulates the algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Problems solved so far include:
- Weird Algorithm

More problems will be added as I progress through the set.
